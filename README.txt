Figure out why Exquisite Leather gives weird values.
Figure out where these uniques drop from: Augyre, Vulconus.
Output the filter file instead of a partial file.
Remove worthless boss drops with shared bases from "Always Show" (Praetor Crown).
Add hardcore support. Possibly add "Always Show" to anything over a certain value.
Add checkboxes on the left side for "Lock Filter Value" and "Force Expected Value".
Force the minimum expected value of non-Warbands League/Crafted/Fated-only drops to 1-2c or separate them into their own yellow border filter.
Separate the "Always Show" filter into multiple filters and remove sound from some of the less valuable items.
