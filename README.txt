* Figure out where these uniques drop from: Augyre, Vulconus.
* Output the filter file instead of a partial file.
* Add checkboxes on the left side for "Lock Filter Value" and "Force Expected Value".
* Force the minimum expected value of non-Warbands League/Crafted/Fated-only drops to 1-2c or separate them into their own yellow border filter.
