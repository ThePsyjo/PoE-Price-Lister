3.5.4
? Fixed colors of all maps.

3.5.3
? Added 13/13 of the new uniques and the new fated unique.
? Updated unique/divination card values.
? Updated the Price Lister and changed the csv to UTF8.
? KNOWN ISSUE: I know that the map colors are not correct. This is a bug that is also affecting Elder spawns, and has nothing to do with my filter. To fix this issue I may have to type in every map name, but I am going to wait a week in hopes that they fix it.

3.5.2
? Fixed a map fragment bug with the regular filter.
? Fixed a few inconsistencies between filters using a diff check.
? Changed most equipment icons from star to square.
? Changed crafting bases from green to blue. Valuable ones like Steel Rings are now red. Shaper/Elder items are still green.
? Changed the icon of jewels and gems to star.
? Reduced the background color and text size of most low value crafting bases.
? Added all 4-links when leveling. Previously some low level ones were hidden.

? Added 5 new Divination Cards + The Nurse
? Added new Map Fragments: Rusted/Polished/Gilded Scarabs (1) (2)
