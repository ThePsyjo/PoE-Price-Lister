3.4.8
? Fixed high value fossil colors/sounds. 
? Reduced low value fossils/resonator colors and removed some from the Strict filters.
? Updated the filter uniques/divination card values. Not much changed, though.
? Changed "hardcore friendly" to only work on items worth 4c+ in hardcore instead of 2c+.
? Fixed filter encoding so it's UTF-8, including the font enlarger. The CSV file is UTF-7. This allows Maelström Staff and Mjölner to parse correctly so I don't have to special case them.

3.4.7
? Fixed fossils so they don't show up as errors. I used the wrong item class.

3.4.6
? Updated the filter uniques/divination card values.
? Added loud sounds to valuable Fossils/Resonators.
? Added colors/beams to the header information.
? Add loud sounds to Shaper/Elder items with rare bases (Opal Rings, etc) and certain 83+ bases.
? Completely refactored the Price Lister code so it's easier to understand. This took almost a week to do. Expected values for uniques still needs a rewrite.
? Added HC Friendly values to the price updater. Anything worth 2c+ in HC will no longer be hidden.

3.4.5
? Updated the filter uniques/divination card values.
? Added many things previously hidden in the Strict filter (Jewels, Uniques, Divination cards).

3.4.4
? Updated the filter values.
? Added some uniques
Spoiler 

3.4.3
? Increased the size of map icons and changed some icons/colors.
? Updated filter/unique values.
? Completely reworked the Elder/Shaper filters. There's now a lot less of them all in one place.
? Added a missed Divination Card: The Cacophony
? Fixed typos for uniques: "The Grey Spire" "Cerberus Limb"
? Added 21/26 new uniques
Spoiler 

3.4.2

3.4.1
? Added Fossil/Resonator currency.
? Added 5 new explicit mods: "Subterranean", "of the Underground", "of Weaponcraft", "of Spellcraft", "of Crafting"
? Added 8 new Divination Cards: 6 of the cards The Endless Darkness, Boon of the First Ones
? Added 6/26 new uniques to the pricing CSV. These have not been added to the filter yet.
