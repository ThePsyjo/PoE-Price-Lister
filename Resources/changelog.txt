---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3.5
* Updated the "Vial of" Incursion currency sounds and colors.
* Added a new release to the Filter Value tool.

3.3.4
* Updated the unique/divination card values again.
* Reworked the currency, gems, and jewels sections.
* Removed some Harbinger currency based on StackSize. Recolored some of these currencies.
* Added HasExplicitMod to items that make it past the pre-filter. These show up the same as high value crafting bases like Steel Rings. Most of these mods are ItemLevel 80+ and require the item to be identified as it drops, so don't expect to see these much.

3.3.3
* Added "Vial of" incursion currency.
* Removed Perandus Coins based on StackSize. Stacks of 1-2 are now hidden in some filters. There is no Perandus Zana mod this league, so it really doesn't matter.

3.3.2
* Updated the uniques and divination card values. I will probably need to do this a few more times over the next couple of weeks as prices adjust to the meta.
* Fixed the "value updater" tool poe.ninja API links.

3.3.1
* Added "Incursion Items" class
* Added level 19+ gems and Empower/Enlighten/Enhance level 2+.
* Updated the csv with 28/31 of the new uniques. The filter hasn't been updated yet because I cannot easily price them.
* Added 22 new Divination cards
